Visibleparticles will show onparticleeffects for everyone in world, disabling this will slightly reduce CPU usage,
Worldthreading is depending on your CPU going into higher values will cause higher CPU usage,
Setting it to lower value will limit world looping and will use lower CPU.
autosave is HIGHLY suggested to be true, but disabling it will disable these:
-Autosave for players (still saved on disconnect)
-Autosave for worlds (still saved once /stop is called if crash RIP)
-Limited buffs won't dissapear unless you relogin the game
-World events will be disabled too
Disabling autosave will lower CPU usage and remove LAG spikes
Disabling jammers will reduce CPU usage
